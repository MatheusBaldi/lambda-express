# 0.1.0 (2019-02-26)

This is the initial release of `@silvermine/lambda-express`. It is fully-functional and
well-tested. It works with both API Gateway and Application Load Balancer. We are still
planning to add a few more features before we cut a 1.0.0 release. You can grep the code
for "TODO" items at commit 1d4f33e to see the list of those potential features and
changes.
